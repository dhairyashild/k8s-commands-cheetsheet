Pod Topology Spread Constraints
              control how Pods are distributed across different failure domains (e.g., regions, zones, nodes) to enhance availability and resource utilization.

Key Components:
maxSkew: Defines the maximum allowed unevenness in Pod distribution. Must be greater than zero.
topologyKey: Specifies the topology domain (like zone or node) for spreading Pods.topology.   (   kubernetes.io/region   , topology.kubernetes.io/zone)
whenUnsatisfiable: Determines the action when constraints cannot be met (e.g., DoNotSchedule keeps the Pod pending).
labelSelector: Filters which Pods the constraints apply to based on labels.

Benefits:
Improves fault tolerance by preventing a single point of failure.
Optimizes resource utilization by distributing workloads evenly.

kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mypod
  labels:
    foo: bar
spec:
  topologySpreadConstraints:
  - maxSkew: 1
    topologyKey: zone
    whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        foo: bar
  containers:
  - name: pause
    image: registry.k8s.io/pause:3.1
Limitations:
Constraints may not remain satisfied if Pods are removed (e.g., during scaling down).

How It Works Together:
Pods are spread across both zones and nodes, ensuring resilience against failures at either domain level.

The scheduler considers both constraints simultaneously, only placing pods where both are satisfied (e.g., a pod must be placed in a specific zone and node).

If constraints cannot be met, scheduling is blocked (DoNotSchedule) until resources align with the rules.
