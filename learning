I've spent over 4 years in DevOps and cloud. 

Here’s a summary of 10 brutal troubleshooting facts I’ve learned:

1) Check logs first, always – Logs contain the first clues; learn how to filter, search, and analyze them efficiently. 

2) Trace the request flow – Understand how a request moves through the system to pinpoint failures faster. 

3) Use process of elimination – Isolate components one by one to find the root cause instead of guessing. 

4) Know the difference between infra and app issues – Is it a misconfigured server, network problem, or bad code? 

5) Validate external dependencies – If your service relies on APIs, databases, or third-party tools, check their status. 

6) Check system resource limits – Running out of memory, CPU, or disk can cause random failures. 

7) Reproduce the issue in a test environment – If possible, recreate the failure to understand it better. 

8) Keep a "known issues" doc – If something breaks often, document the fix so you (or others) don’t waste time. 

9) Use health checks effectively – Proper liveness and readiness probes can detect and prevent hidden failures. 

10) Know when to escalate – If you've checked the usual suspects and still can't fix it, don't waste time, get help.
